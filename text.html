<h1 style="textColor: red"><strong>Is Cereal A Soup?</strong></h1>
<p>There has been a long and thoughtful descussion on <i>if cereal is a soup or not</i> and we are here to determin what it actually is.</p>

<h2>Now there are many reasons as to why it could be qualified as a soup:</h2>
<ol>
<b>  <li>cereal is a liquid</li>
    <li>it is chuncky just like soup</li>
    <li>and soup doesnt always have to be hot(like cereal)</li></b>
</ol>
<h3>But there are a couple things in question<h3>
  <ul>
    <li>is milk considered a broth?</li>
    <li>would placing any liquid into a bowl concider it a broth?</li>
    <li>and, what would oatmeal be?</li>
</ul>
<p> Now these things might never be answered and we might jsut be left questioning this subject for the rest of our lives</p>
<blockquote> In my opinion cereal is just cereal but there might be many that dissagree</blockquote>
<code>now theres another problem at hand; <small>is a hot dog a sandwich?</small><ins>bahaha(evil laugh)</ins></code>
<p> Unfortunetly we will not be getting to that today because we are still trying to figure out the cereal situation so I'll leave that one up to you to decide.</p>
<h4><del>CEREAL IS A SOUP</del></h4>

<p> sorry about that <mark>:/</mark></p>
  <p>cereal is still just cereal. It cant be defined as somethig else becasue its just cereal.</p>
<sub>oh no the cereal is flying away!</sub>
